            Priyanka Agarwal is an entrepreneur and a fashion enthusiast with a
            keen eye for aesthetics, detail, and design. Uptownie was born out
            of her desire to empower Indian women with affordable and fuss-free
            clothing that complements their body type and physicality.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[13px] mt-4">
            Priyanka graduated from Duke University with a Bachelor of Science
            (BSc) in Economics and Math, and a specialization in Marketing and
            Visual Arts. Her work at Uptownie is a blend of fortes gathered
            through her years as a student. She also draws upon 40 years of her
            family’s experience within the fields of manufacturing and exports,
            to bring perfection to the production process.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[13px] mt-4">
            After 8 years of extensive experience working in the fashion
            industry, and churning out over 10,000 unique designs, Priyanka
            knows how a masterful play with colours, cuts, textures, patterns,
            and styles can bring out individuality and confidence in a woman.
            She endeavours to challenge beauty stereotypes and invites women
            from all over the country to join in an unabashed celebration of
            their own bodies. She steers away from designing for the ramp, and
            uses her clothes as a medium to communicate with the women of today
            and give them a chance to express their best selves.

            The driving force of the company is a team of young and urban Indian
            women who wear the shoes of our customers in every step of their
            way. We design fuss-free and chic clothes, keeping in mind that no
            one has the time for endless ironing, slips, nips and tucks,
            shoulders that slip off, or unflattering cuts.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[13px] mt-4">
            Our digital store is run by 50 young men and women who work across
            all departments: from marketing and designing, to warehousing, with
            a gusto for growth. The Uptownie office is a space of equal
            opportunity and a conducive environment for tremendous growth in the
            field of fashion.

          <p className="text-[13px] mt-4">
            We envision a world where every body shape and size is celebrated.
            Your outfit is never “too bold” or “too well-fitted” or “too
            casual,” it is always a personal expression of your inner beauty.
            Scrolling through our store is never a hunt for what’s good, but
            always a tough pick between many great choices.
